# 2025: The Year of Preparation 🚀

Last year was all about laying the groundwork for our official launch in **2026**. We focused on refining our infrastructure, perfecting the user experience, and pushing the boundaries of our software suite.

## 🏗️ Building the Foundation
To ensure a seamless transition into our launch year, we dedicated 2025 to "under-the-hood" excellence:

* **Platform Readiness:** Built and rigorously tested our primary website.
* **Customer Success:** Developed robust support features to ensure our users are never left behind.
* **Continuous Improvement:** 2025 became the most update-heavy year in our history, with a special focus on **Visually**.

## 🎨 Focus: Visually
Visually underwent a massive evolution this year. After opening it up to the public, the feedback we received became the catalyst for rapid innovation.

### Key Milestones & Pivots

* **Public Debut:** We launched the first public version in early 2025, gaining invaluable insights from our early adopters.
* **The Cloud Shift:** * *The Challenge:* We realized that **P2P (peer-to-peer) transfers** were hitting a bottleneck, limiting our progress.
    * *The Solution:* We acted quickly. Around April, we pivoted our focus toward **cloud functionality**, delivering a major infrastructure update that solved these scaling issues.

> **Looking Ahead:** With a year of intense patching, feature-building, and constructive feedback behind us, we are more than ready for 2026.
